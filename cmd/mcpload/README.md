# mcpload CLI

`mcpload` wraps a k6 binary built with [`xk6-mcpload`](../../xk6-mcpload). It runs a scenario, samples the server's resources while the run is going, computes leak and drift verdicts, and writes `report.json` ([schema v1](../../report/schema/README.md)) and a self-contained `report.html`.

## Build

```sh
cd cmd/mcpload
go build -o mcpload.exe .          # Windows; use -o mcpload elsewhere
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=v0.3.0" -o mcpload .   # stamp a version
go vet ./... && go test ./...
```

`mcpload` needs the custom k6 binary. By default it uses `./k6.exe` or `./k6` in the working directory, then `k6` on `PATH`. Use `--k6` to point at a different one. The HTML template is embedded, so Node isn't needed.

## Commands

```text
mcpload run --scenario <file.js> --url <mcp url> [flags]
mcpload render <report.json> <out.html>
mcpload validate <report.json>
mcpload upload --url <upload server base url> --key <api key> <report.json>
mcpload version
```

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The run passed: no verdict is `fail` and every threshold passed. Warnings are allowed. |
| 1 | The run failed: a verdict is `fail` or a k6 threshold failed. `report.json` and `report.html` are still written. |
| 2 | Usage or runtime error, such as bad flags, k6 not found, the sampler probe failing, k6 crashing, a failed upload, or a report that fails its semantic checks. |

### `run` flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--scenario` | (required) | k6 script, e.g. `scenarios/soak.js` |
| `--url` | (required) | MCP endpoint, passed to k6 as `MCP_URL` |
| `--protocol` | `auto` | `MCP_PROTOCOL` |
| `--k6` | `./k6.exe`, `./k6`, then `k6` on PATH | k6 binary built with xk6-mcpload |
| `--sampler` | `none` | `none`, `docker` or `prometheus` |
| `--container` | | container name or id, for `--sampler docker` |
| `--prom-url` | | Prometheus text endpoint, e.g. `http://localhost:3001/metrics`, for `--sampler prometheus` |
| `--interval` | `10s` | sampling interval, which is also the width of the series buckets (use ≥ 5s with docker) |
| `--soak-min` | 30 | `SOAK_MIN`: constant-load minutes |
| `--warmup-min` | 10% of soak, at least 1 | `WARMUP_MIN` |
| `--cooldown-min` | 5 | `COOLDOWN_MIN` |
| `--vus` | | passed to the script as `VUS`, a scenario knob. It is **not** k6 `--vus`, which would replace the script's scenarios. |
| `--duration` | | passed to the script as `DURATION`, a scenario knob |
| `--env K=V` | | extra `-e K=V` for k6, repeatable (e.g. `--env RATE=1 --env THINK_MS=200`). Explicit flags win over `--env`. |
| `--label` | | short display name for the target |
| `--git-sha`, `--git-ref` | `$GITHUB_SHA`, `$GITHUB_REF` | revision of the system under test. The sha must be 7–64 lowercase hex characters. |
| `--out` | `report.json` | report path |
| `--html` | | also write the HTML report here |
| `--upload-url`, `--key` | key from `$MCPLOAD_KEY` | POST the report to `{url}/api/v1/runs` on a server that accepts report uploads, once it is written |
| `--leak-slope-mb-per-min` | 1 | `memory_leak` RSS slope limit in MiB/min (1 MiB = 1,048,576 bytes; the flag name says "mb" for compatibility) |
| `--min-r2` | 0.7 | minimum R² for a leak slope to count |
| `--include-payloads` | false | sets `INCLUDE_PAYLOADS=1` and `payloadsIncluded: true` |
| `--k6-out` | (temp dir, deleted) | keep k6's raw `metrics.ndjson` and `summary.json` in this directory |

`--soak-min`, `--warmup-min`, `--cooldown-min`, `--vus` and `--duration` reach k6 only when you set them. When a flag is left out, the script uses its own default. The CLI computes report phases with the same defaults as `scenarios/soak.js`.

## Examples

```sh
# Healthy target, Prometheus sampler, short soak
./mcpload run --scenario scenarios/soak.js --url http://localhost:3001/mcp \
  --sampler prometheus --prom-url http://localhost:3001/metrics \
  --soak-min 4 --warmup-min 1 --cooldown-min 1 --interval 5s \
  --out healthy.json --html healthy.html

# Leaky target, docker sampler (expect memory_leak: fail, exit 1)
./mcpload run --scenario scenarios/soak.js --url http://localhost:3002/mcp \
  --sampler docker --container mcpload-demo-ts-leaky-1 \
  --soak-min 4 --warmup-min 1 --cooldown-min 1 --interval 5s --env RATE=1 \
  --out leaky.json --html leaky.html

# Plain load test, client-side signals only
./mcpload run --scenario scenarios/agent-session.js --url http://localhost:3001/mcp --vus 5 --duration 1m

./mcpload validate report.json
./mcpload render report.json report.html
MCPLOAD_KEY=... ./mcpload upload --url https://reports.example.com report.json
```

## How `run` works

1. It resolves the k6 binary and runs `k6 version`. It then runs `k6 inspect` with the same `-e` env to read the script's thresholds, scenarios (for `run.load`) and the `scenario_name` tag (for `run.scenario`; when the tag is missing, the script's file name is used).
2. For `docker` or `prometheus`, it takes one probe sample and exits 2 if that fails. It then starts sampling every `--interval`.
3. It runs `k6 run --out json=<tmp>/metrics.ndjson --summary-export <tmp>/summary.json --summary-trend-stats ... -e ... <script>`. k6's stdout and stderr stream through. Ctrl-C reaches k6, which stops gracefully, and mcpload still writes the report. k6 exit codes 0 and 99 (thresholds failed) count as normal. Any other exit code produces a report but returns exit 2.
4. It stops the sampler and streams the NDJSON twice without loading it all into memory. The first pass finds the earliest sample, which becomes the run start and `t = 0`. The second pass computes:
   - client series per bucket: p95 of every `mcp_req_duration` sample; `mcp_errors / mcp_reqs` (`null` when there were no requests); and rps (`mcp_reqs / interval`);
   - `tools[]`: `mcp_reqs`, `mcp_errors` and `mcp_req_duration` with `method=tools/call`, grouped by `tool`, using k6's percentile interpolation;
   - `summary`: totals and `byErrorType` from the `error_type` tag;
   - `run.protocol`: the most common `protocol` tag on successful `mcp_connect_duration` samples. This skips the `auto` probe. If none is found, `--protocol` is used unless it is `auto`; otherwise the value is `unknown`;
   - `thresholds[]`: one entry per expression from `k6 inspect`, plus any extras in the summary export. `passed` comes from k6's summary export, where `true` means *failed*. `observed` is recomputed from the raw samples, so it is available for any `p(N)`, `avg`, `rate` or `count`.
5. Server points are averaged into the same buckets: `t` = bucket start in seconds from run start. Docker fills only `rssBytes`. Prometheus fills `rssBytes`, `heapBytes`, `openFds` and `activeSessions`, with `null` where a metric is missing.
6. Phases: for `soak`, they come from `SOAK_MIN`, `WARMUP_MIN` and `COOLDOWN_MIN`. Any other scenario uses `warmupEndS = 0` and `loadEndS = cooldownEndS = durationS`.
7. Verdicts are `analysis.Verdicts` (memory, session and fd leak, latency and error drift), then `session_not_found`, then `threshold`. mcpload then runs `report.Check()`, writes the JSON and the HTML, uploads when asked, prints the verdict lines and exits.

Docker (`MemUsage`, which is the cgroup) and Prometheus (`process_resident_memory_bytes`) report RSS on different scales. Compare slopes only within one sampler.
